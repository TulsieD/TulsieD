I am a cybersecurity professional with a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and over 3 years of IT support experience. My expertise includes security operations, endpoint management, and vulnerability assessment, and I am currently building hands-on projects in ServiceNow SecOps, SIEM, and incident response to strengthen my skills for consulting roles in security operations.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
My goal is to transition into a security operations role, leveraging my IT background, industry certifications (CySA+, PenTest+, Security+), and ongoing portfolio projects to deliver scalable and secure solutionsâ€”while building expertise in ServiceNow SecOps consulting.
